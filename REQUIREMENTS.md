Movie recommender

Natural language input from user

Use csv files to recommend 5-10 movies that the user might like

If the user asks
"I want a movie about a ship that hits an iceberg."

We want to pull up movies that fit that description

General strategy proposed: embed descriptions and/or keywords from keywords.csv and movies_metadata.csv. save those embeddings (supabase?)
